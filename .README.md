How to setup and run the terraform tests (to be updated/refined)

1. CD into the storage folder dir
2. From within the storage dir, type `terraform test` in the terminal
3. This will execute the terraform tests and subsequently tear down resources

As an illustration, if everything was setup correctly you should get the following upon running `terraform test`:

`tests/main.tftest.hcl... in progress`
  `run "storage_account_variables_validation"... pass`
  `run "setup"... pass`
  `run "storage_account_attribute_actual_vs_expected_test"... pass`
`tests/main.tftest.hcl... tearing down`
`tests/main.tftest.hcl... pass`
